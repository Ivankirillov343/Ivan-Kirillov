## About me
I’m a hockey player who works just as hard in school as I do on the ice. Between practices, games, and workouts, I stay focused on my goal of getting high grades by managing my time and putting in the effort to study. Being successful in the classroom matters to me, because I want to show that I can excel both as an athlete and as a student.
